* Glossary

- Abstract Dependency :: A dependency declaration with loose version constraints (e.g., =numpy>=1.20=) as found in =pyproject.toml=, maximizing compatibility with other packages.
- Artifact :: A file produced by the build process, typically a source distribution (=.tar.gz=) or a wheel (=.whl=).
- Build Backend :: The tool that converts source code into installable artifacts (e.g., =hatchling=, =meson-python=, =setuptools=, =uv_build=).
- Build Frontend :: The tool that invokes the build backend (e.g., =uv build=, =pip wheel=, =python -m build=).
- cibuildwheel :: A tool that builds binary wheels for multiple platforms using CI services such as GitHub Actions.
- Concrete Dependency :: An exact, pinned version of a package (e.g., =numpy==2.1.0=) as recorded in a lockfile, ensuring reproducibility.
- =conda-forge= :: A community-maintained channel of =conda= packages providing both Python libraries and system-level binaries.
- Constraint Satisfaction :: The process a package manager uses to find a set of dependency versions that simultaneously satisfy all requirements without conflicts.
- Continuous Integration (CI) :: The practice of automatically running tests and checks on every code push, typically using a service like GitHub Actions.
- Dependency Group :: A named set of dependencies in =pyproject.toml= (e.g., =dev=, =docs=) that can be installed selectively. Defined by PEP 735.
- Editable Install :: An installation mode (=uv pip install -e .=) where changes to source code are immediately reflected without reinstalling.
- F2PY :: A tool (part of NumPy) that generates Python bindings for Fortran subroutines, producing C wrapper code and shared objects.
- GitHub Actions :: A CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub that runs workflows defined in YAML files on push, pull request, or other events.
- Inline Script Metadata :: A PEP 723 feature that embeds dependency declarations directly in a Python script using a special comment block (=# /// script=).
- Lockfile :: A file (e.g., =uv.lock=) that pins the exact versions of all direct and transitive dependencies for reproducibility.
- Manylinux :: A standard that defines a minimal set of Linux system libraries a binary wheel may depend on, ensuring broad compatibility across distributions.
- Matrix Strategy :: A CI configuration that runs the same job across multiple combinations of parameters (e.g., Python versions and operating systems).
- Meson :: A build system used for compiling C, C++, and Fortran code into shared libraries. Used by NumPy and SciPy.
- =meson-python= :: A PEP 517 build backend that integrates the Meson build system with Python packaging, enabling compiled extensions in wheels.
- Module :: A single =.py= file that can be imported.
- News Fragment :: A small text file (e.g., =news/42.feature=) used by =towncrier= to record a single changelog entry, avoiding merge conflicts.
- OIDC (Trusted Publishing) :: An authentication method allowing GitHub Actions to publish to PyPI without storing API tokens, using OpenID Connect identity verification.
- Package :: A directory containing an =__init__.py= file (and usually other modules), making it importable as a unit.
- PEP :: Python Enhancement Proposal. A design document that describes a new feature or standard for Python. Key PEPs in this lesson: 518, 517, 621, 668, 723, 735, 751.
- =pixi= :: A cross-platform package manager for managing system dependencies and task automation via =conda-forge=.
- Pixibang :: A shebang line (=#!/usr/bin/env -S pixi exec ... -- uv run=) that chains =pixi= and =uv= to provide both system binaries and Python packages for a single script.
- =prek= :: A Rust rewrite of the =pre-commit= tool for running git hooks that enforce code quality checks before commits.
- Pre-commit Hook :: A git hook that runs automated checks (linting, formatting) before a commit is finalized, preventing bad code from entering the repository.
- =pyproject.toml= :: The standard configuration file for Python projects (PEP 621), replacing =setup.py= and =setup.cfg=.
- PyPI :: The Python Package Index, the default repository for Python packages.
- =pytest= :: A testing framework for Python that discovers and runs test functions, providing detailed failure reports.
- =ruff= :: An extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust, replacing =flake8=, =black=, and =isort=.
- Shadowing :: When a local file has the same name as a standard library module (e.g., =math.py=), causing Python to import the local file instead.
- Shared Object :: A compiled binary (=.so= on Linux, =.dylib= on macOS, =.dll= on Windows) that Python can load as an extension module.
- Shebang :: The first line of a script (starting with =#!=) that tells the operating system which interpreter to use to execute the file.
- Source Distribution (sdist) :: A compressed archive of the source code (=.tar.gz=) that requires a build step before installation.
- Sphinx :: The standard documentation generator for Python projects, converting reStructuredText or Markdown into HTML, PDF, or other formats.
- =src= Layout :: A project structure where the package source lives under a =src/= directory, preventing accidental imports from the project root.
- =sys.path= :: The list of directories Python searches when resolving =import= statements.
- Test PyPI :: A separate instance of PyPI (=test.pypi.org=) used for testing package uploads without affecting the production index.
- =towncrier= :: A tool for managing changelogs using per-change fragment files to avoid merge conflicts.
- Transitive Dependency :: A package that is not directly required by your project but is pulled in as a dependency of one of your direct dependencies.
- =uv= :: A fast Python package installer and project manager from Astral, written in Rust.
- =uvx= :: A tool runner from =uv= that fetches and executes a command-line tool in an ephemeral environment without permanent installation.
- Virtual Environment :: An isolated Python environment with its own =site-packages= directory, preventing dependency conflicts between projects.
- Wheel :: A binary distribution format (=.whl=) that can be installed without a build step. It is essentially a ZIP archive with a standardized layout.
